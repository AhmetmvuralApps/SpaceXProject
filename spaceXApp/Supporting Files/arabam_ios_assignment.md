- You can use Swift or Objective-C.
- You should use storyboard and autolayout.
- Apart from very specialized topics (image processing, etc.) avoid using 3rd party dependencies, but if you need to use it, you should use CocoaPods.

### Project
------------------------------------

We want you to write a small application using the SpaceX-API.

- All information about the API is available in the following URL:
    https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API
    https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/launches

- The application will mainly consist of a table view.
- All SpaceX launches can be listed.
- Mission Patch image that returns from the response must also be in the list.
- On the main screen there should be "Filter" option, it can be added to the right of the navigation bar as a button and can be opened modally.
- The launch list can be filtered by year and sorted by order
- The user should be directed to the detail screen when selecting one of the results listed in the table view.
- There is no obligation about list and detail screen design, you can configure this screen as you like.
- Inspect the API carefully and be creative :)
